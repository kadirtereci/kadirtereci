I have been working as a full stack developer. I'm using ReactJS on the frontend. I'm actively using Material Ui,styled component,functional component. On the backend, I'm using NodeJS in NestJS framework. I use Typescript and I pay attention to type definitions. I'm also working with PostgreSql, Redis, Nestjs, TypeORM and responsible for ci/cd processes in the project.
