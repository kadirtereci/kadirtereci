I have been working as a full stack developer for about 2 years. I'm using reactjs on the frontend. I'm actively using Material Ui,styled component,functional component. On the backend, I'm using nodejs in nestjs framework. I use typescript and I pay attention to type definitions. I've also worked with PostgreSql, Redis, Nestjs, TypeORM. I've been working with graphql lately. I am also responsible for ci/cd processes in the project. We have a bitbucket runner that we host on our own server. I direct deploy operations through it. I deployed our applications in docker using Dokku, I made the database and minio(like aws s3) configurations that we host ourselves. I have installed Nginx, firewall, etc. Recently, I am also interested in the cloud side and I want to learn google cloud.
